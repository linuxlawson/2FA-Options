### 2FA-Options  
Just a few notes on 2FA, for personal reference really.  
This is mostly a matter of personal preference.  
Below is just my own opinion.  

<br>

**1. SMS/Text message**  
   - easy setup
   - least secure
   - least convenient
   - better than no 2FA
     
<br>  

**2. Authenticator App** (or password manager such as: keepassxc)  
   - harder setup (if not familiar)  
   - more secure than sms
   - more convenient 
   - better option than sms  

  <br>  

**3. Security Key** (yubikey or similar)  
   - hardest setup (can be confusing if not familiar)  
   - best security (requires physical device plugged into computer)
   - convenient    
   - best overall  

  <br>  
  

**4. Mobile App** (phone app)  
   - have not tried

  <br>  
  <br>

**Recovery Codes**  
    Always keep recovery codes in a seperate safe place.  
    You will need these in case you lose access to other methods.

<br>  

**Passkeys (optional)**  
    Passkeys are a seperate option from 2FA and not required.    
    You can use these for personal convenience.
