### 2FA-Options  
Just a few notes on 2FA, for personal reference really.  

This is mostly a matter of personal preference.  
Notes below are just my opinion on the matter.

<br>

**1. SMS/Text message**  
   - easy setup
   - least secure
   - least convenient (must have phone with you, and powered on to sign in)
   - better than no 2FA
   - cost: free (assuming you have a phone)
     
<br>  

**2. Authenticator App** (or password manager such as KeePassXC)  
   - harder setup (if not familiar)  
   - more secure than sms
   - more convenient (requires additional steps but no phone needed)
   - better option than sms
   - cost: free

**3. Security Key** (yubikey or similar)  
   - hardest setup (can be confusing if not familiar)  
   - very secure (requires physical device (usb) be plugged into computer)
   - convenient    
   - best overall
   - cost: yubikeys can be had for around $30.00

**4. Mobile App** (phone app)  
   - have not tried

  <br><br>

**Recovery Codes**  
    Always keep recovery codes in a seperate safe place.  
    You will need these in case you lose access to other 2FA methods.

<br>  

**Passkeys (optional)**  
    Passkeys are a seperate option from 2FA and not required.    
    You can use these for personal convenience.
