### 2FA-Options  
Just a few notes on 2FA, for personal reference really.  

This is mostly a matter of personal preference.  
Notes below are just my opinion on the matter.

<br>

**1. SMS/Text message**  
   - Easy setup
   - Least secure
   - Least convenient (must have phone with you, and powered on to sign in)
   - Better than no 2FA
   - Cost: free (assuming you have a phone)
     
<br>  

**2. Authenticator App** (or password manager such as KeePassXC)  
   - Harder setup (if not familiar)  
   - More secure than sms
   - More convenient (requires additional steps but no phone needed)
   - Better option than sms
   - Cost: free

**3. Security Key** (yubikey or similar)  
   - Easy  
   - Very secure (requires physical device (usb) be plugged in)
   - Convenient    
   - Best overall
   - Cost: Yubikeys can be had for around $30.00

**4. Mobile App**
   - have not tried

  <br><br>

**Recovery Codes**  
    Always keep recovery codes in a seperate safe place.  
    You will need these in case you lose access to other 2FA methods.

<br>  

**Passkeys (optional)**  
    Passkeys are a seperate option from 2FA and not required.    
    You can use these for personal convenience.

**Good Tutorial** for using KeePassXC as your Authenticator App: [KeePassXC Tutorial](https://www.linux.org/threads/in-depth-tutorial-how-to-set-up-2fa-totp-with-keepassxc-aegis-and-authy.36577/)
