### 2FA-Options

2FA Options

1. SMS(text message)
    easiest setup, least secure, better than no 2FA


2. Authenticator App (or password manager such as: keepassxc)
    harder setup, more secure than sms, better option than sms


3. Security Key (yubikey or similar)
    hardest setup, best security, best overall    


4. Mobile App (phone app)
    have not tried


Recovery Codes
    Always keep your recovery codes in a seperate safe place.
    You will need these in case you loose access to other methods.


Passkeys (optional)
    Passkeys are a seperate option from 2FA and not required
    You can use these for personal convenience
    Have not tried (yet)
